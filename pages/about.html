            DOMS Industries Limited, as we know it today, traces its lineage back to over 4 decades, with the formation
            of a
            partnership firm, ‘R.R. Industries’ by our founders, Late Shri Rasiklal Amritlal Raveshia and Late Shri
            Mansukhlal Jamnadas Rajani, which over the years undertook the business of manufacturing and sale of
            scholastic
            stationery; scholastic art material; paper stationery; kits and combos; office supplies; hobby and craft;
            and
            fine art products.

        <p class="heading-1">Robust Growth</p>
        <p>
            We launched our flagship brand, “DOMS” in 2005, which has taken large strides in revolutionising the Indian
            ‘stationery and art material’ industry. This was followed by a strategic partnership with a listed Italian
            multinational company, engaged in the supply of various ‘art materials’ and ‘stationery products’, with a
            global presence, F.I.L.A. – Fabbrica Italiana Lapis ed Affini S.p.A (F.I.L.A.), Italy, in 2012, which has
            enabled us to gain access to international markets for distribution of our products, augmentation of our R&D
            and technological capabilities. Later, we acquired Pioneer Stationery Private Limited, a company engaged in
            the business of manufacturing, selling, marketing and distribution of paper stationery products. In 2023, we
            acquired a minority stake in ClapJoy Innovations Private Limited, which is in the business of manufacturing
            and sale of ‘toys’. This acquisition is in line with our objective to increase the breadth of our product
            offering by entering categories that are associated through the growing years of kids, children and young
            adults. Further, in the year 2023, we acquired a majority stake in Micro Wood Private Limited, which is in
            the business of manufacturing tin and paper based packing material. This acquisition is in line with our
            Company’s strategy in achieving greater degree of backward integration for manufacturing.

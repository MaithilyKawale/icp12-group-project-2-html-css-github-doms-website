    <p><strong>Modelling a legend.</strong> It is an invention that sprang from the creative flair of the poet and writer Dario Sala, from whom it takes its name. <strong>DAS</strong> is the most well-known and popular modelling paste for professionals, enthusiasts and children. With a mineral base, it dries in the air and produces solid and durable objects. It is particularly suitable for application on wood, cardboard and terracotta.</p>

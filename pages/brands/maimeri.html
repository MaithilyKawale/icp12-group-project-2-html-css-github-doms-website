      <strong>Maimeri</strong> The Maimeri industry was born at the begining of the last century from a dream. The dream of an artist to be able to conceive and produce colors suitable for art by combining traditional ones formulas now distorted by the imposition of industrialization and a high standard that only the new ones modern industrial machinery could guarantee.
